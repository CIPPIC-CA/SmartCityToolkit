  <li>De-identify as soon as possible.  If personal information absolutely must be collected, it should be stripped away as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Use non-identifying information as password to voting. Create a secure password on the residentâ€™s voting card limiting the use of identifying information during the actual vote.</li>
