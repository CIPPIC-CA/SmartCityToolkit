## Exploring the Smart City

Smart City tools and applications are all around us. This toolkit describes many different smart city applications and tools already in use in cities today. Explore the cityscape below to see the different areas of municipal activity and service that employ smart city approaches. Click on the map to explore specific applications and technologies. Smart city solutions should not be blindly adapted, but instead implemented in ways that assess and account for risks and unforeseen effects. Each solution described discusses common risks and their management.

Beneath the cityscape we've identified five "meta-issues": privacy, security, inclusion, intellectual property, and inclusion. These meta-issues recur time and time again as municipalities consider, select, and implement smart city approaches to providing municipal services. Clicking on each meta-issue leads to a discussion of approaches to and resources and tools for addressing these meta-issues in pro-active ways.

## About this Toolkit

This toolkit was made available to you through an investment from [Infrastructure Canada](https://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/cities-villes/index-eng.html), and the hard work of the law students of CIPPIC, the [Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic](https://cippic.ca/) of the [Common Law Section of the Faculty of Law, University of Ottawa](https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en).
