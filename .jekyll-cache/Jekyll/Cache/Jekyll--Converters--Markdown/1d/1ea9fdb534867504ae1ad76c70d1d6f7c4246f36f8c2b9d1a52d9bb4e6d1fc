<p>Citizens who collaborate in the development of smart cities can gain control over their data and how it is used. In smart cities, real-time data exchange between citizens and governments allow citizens to participate in decisions about their city. This also allows for a flexible approach that takes into account the changes that a particular municipality may experience over time.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll look at three civic empowerment applications:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Improving access to townhall meetings,</li>
  <li>Encouraging residents to vote, and</li>
  <li>Hackathons.</li>
</ol>
