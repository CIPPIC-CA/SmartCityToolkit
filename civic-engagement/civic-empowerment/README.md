# Civic Empowerment

Citizens who collaborate in the development of smart cities can gain control over their data and how it is used. In smart cities, real-time data exchange between citizens and governments allow citizens to participate in decisions about their city. This also allows for a flexible approach that takes into account the changes that a particular municipality may experience over time.

We'll look at three civic empowerment applications: 1. Improving access to townhall meetings, 1. Encouraging residents to vote, and 1. Hackathons.
