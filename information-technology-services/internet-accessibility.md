# Internet Accessibility

Daily life has become increasingly governed by online services. Everything from the banks we rely on, the government services we apply for, the entertainment we consume, and the platforms we use to communicate with each other rely on not only being connected to the internet, but rather always being connected to the internet. Unfortunately, this can present some very significant issues of access to those who can’t afford, don’t understand, or don’t have access to cellular mobile data – which is usually necessary for people to access the web when they’re not at home. These issues are even worse for those who don’t have home internet service, and are forced to use the Wi-Fi of their school, library, or a private business to access a world that has essentially all but gone online.

For this reason, municipalities should at least begin to consider ways they can ensure that the people that live and work there are able to access all the services they need, when and where they need them.

## Applications and Solutions: Municipal Wi-Fi

Municipal Wi-Fi ensures that anyone with a wi-fi enabled device is able to access the internet while within a certain area – typically municipal city or town limits – for a limited fee or no fee at all. Essentially, it approaches wi-fi as a utility essential to daily life as opposed to an optional service, and seeks to facilitate the practice of accessing the internet anywhere, at any time.

## Technologies

**Access Point Grid** – Uses strategically placed conventional wi-fi routers located in municipal properties to provide wi-fi service in certain areas. While signal boosters can be used to extend the range of one signal throughout the building, service will typically not be available in outdoor areas.

**Wireless Mesh Networks** – Utilizes a network of radio transmitters to provide a “cloud” of wi-fi that spans to both indoor and outdoor locations. The radio transmitters re-transmit the wi-fi signal from an originating access point, allowing for internet to be provided in areas a conventional router cannot reach.

**Commercially-owned Networks or Sponsorships** – Some municipalities have chosen to provide municipal wif-fi over pre-existing private cellular data networks or internet infrastructure. Others have used Access Point Grids or Wireless Mesh Networks that are sponsored by private companies and funded by advertisements.

**Fibre Networks** – Sometimes acting as a subsect of commercially-owned networks and otherwise funded by the municipality itself, Fibre optic networks provide high-speed wired internet to residences, workplaces, and other places present within a municipal community. The municipality then is able to directly charge citizens for internet access, typically at a more affordable cost than a traditional ISP. Corporate sponsored Fibre is also typically offered at a greatly reduced cost or provided for free.

## Managing Liability Issues

| Reliability and Cost |
| :--- |
| **Issues.** |
| ⚠ Because Wireless Mesh Networks require a fair amount of radio receivers to function effectively, there is a notable cost to having them installed and administered by the municipality. Likewise, Fibre Networks can also be costly to install. Wireless Mesh Networks also may prove ineffective if people’s homes are not located centrally in the wi-fi “cloud” – while the signal from the receivers may reach their wi-fi enabled device, their device may be unable to communicate properly with the transmitter. |
| **Managing Issues.** |
| ✅ Distribute costs. The cost of the municipally-provided internet service could potentially be distributed evenly across the municipality through mechanisms like property taxes or utilities. |
| ✅ Pursue sponsorships. Municipalities may offset the cost of both Access Point Grids, Wireless Mesh Networks, and Fibre Networks by having a private company sponsor them. Landing pages that appear when the wi-fi is connected to may feature an advertisement, or an advertisement may be placed in the building or transportation where the access point is located. |
| ✅ Provide boosting equipment. Equipment to connect to a Wireless Mesh network in a residential building may be provided by the municipality at a reasonable cost. Monthly cost could also be charged for the provision of the service. |
| ✅ Be redundant when possible. In the case of Wireless Mesh Networks, the more receivers are in the “mesh”, the more reliable the service. Even if a few receivers in the mesh are rendered inoperative, service should continue without interruption. Wireless Mesh Networks can also be used in conjunction with Access Points or limited Fibre networks to ensure internet service is provided with a fair amount of reliability. |

| Privacy and Security |
| :--- |
| **Issues.** |
| ⚠ Municipalities have few means of ensuring that privately-owned networks that provide municipal wi-fi or Fibre internet do not improperly collect user data.  Even if the municipality itself provides and administers the network, like all forms of public wi-fi, it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, sniffing, and malicious hotspots. |
| **Managing Issues.** |
| ✅ Ensure private networks do not collect data on users. One of the main concerns of municipalities in negotiating privately-administered municipal wi-fi of Fibre agreements is that user data is not improperly collected or used. |
| ✅ Anonymize data. Alternatively, municipalities may allow for data collection, but stipulate that data be stripped of most or all identifying features. |
| ✅ Use encrypted networks. Encrypted networks usually ensure that communications between the router and the user are private. |
| ✅ Encourage use of websites that use HTTPS protocol. HTTPS protocol is more secure and will help protect user’s private data. Sites that do not use HTTPS protocol that are accessed via municipal wifi could be accompanied by a warning or disclaimer. |
| ✅ Encourage the use of VPNs. Virtual Private Networks \(VPNs\) help keep user data private and out of the hands of those unauthorized to possess it for a small fee. Municipal wi-fi systems may make use of a landing page that encourages use of a VPN when using the system. |
| ✅ Include disclaimers. The wi-fi’s landing page should include a disclaimer that sets out the risk of using public wi-fi and allows users to agree to the risks to access the service. |
