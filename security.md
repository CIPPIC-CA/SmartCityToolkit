# Municipal Security 

A smart city must also be a secure city. The use of information technology and networked devices greatly expands the surface area available to attackers.  Municipalities are already targets of cyberattacks and ransomware attacks.  Accordingly, digital security will be an enormous issue for municipalities going forward. 

Security-by-Design is crucial in addressing the security challenges in smart cities.  This involves putting security interests at the forefront of all stages of the technology life cycle:  selection, operation and maintenance, and disposal of technology.

## Why does Smart City Technology Pose Security Challenges? 

Like most organizations, modern municipalities use information technology tools to deliver services and manage operations.  Accordingly, municipalities encounter the security challenges all users of such technology face:  vulnerabilities and bugs that, if unpatched, permit cyber-attackers access, and internal mistakes and bad actors. The smart city expands the surface area for external attacks and complicates internal security management.  Why? The smart city uses more systems, new systems, and third party systems, all of which need to be managed and all of which carry with them their own security challenges.
 
Security challenges include data and identity theft, system vulnerability, and cyber-attacks on IoT endpoints, man-in-the-middle attacks, fraudulent software updates, cryptanalysis, protocol and authentication tokens attacks, signal interference through either jamming or tag killing, spoofing, and compromising location privacy including GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth. For instance, in the healthcare sector, technologies may pose interoperability and integration problems, especially if the provision of software and services is by a third party. This can threaten data integrity, compromise private communications, electronic health records, and impeded the flow of healthcare data and this is just a sector in the smart city. 

## How should Municipalities approach Security in Smart City Procurement

Municipalities must implement security-by-design in every design stage and procurement process of smart city technology. Smart city technologies must be brought within the security policies of the municipality, and these processes themselves must be adapted to address the security risks new smart city technologies bring with them.  Standard security practices will include:
•	Protecting personal information and privacy - This includes masking of personal data in the design process using encryption (DES, RSA, and AES for sensor networks), hashing (hash link, and hash lock), minimalist cryptography, and differential privacy.
•	Using security technology - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on all technologies in existence before the implementation of security-by-design. Additional protection includes the installation of antivirus and firewalls, software updates to patch software vulnerabilities and security flaws, the use of digital signatures, and secure APIs.
•	Develop security impact assessment tools – Checklists and other such tools assess the impact of smart cities technologies on security and privacy at an early stage. Some terms to include in the checklist may be securing information and communication, standard protection of data and identity, the level of authentication and its process, elimination of weak points, firmware update timeframe, protocols for security breaches, etc.
•	Develop human security policies – Many cyber attacks exploit human gullibility.  In this environment, security is everyone’s responsibility.  Training, access policies and credential enforcement will help address security vulnerabilities that no amount of software can patch.
•	Consider Open Source Software – All software has security vulnerabilities.  Open source software benefits from a community of peers able to review and improve the software.  As collaboration expands, the quality of the software improves. Closed source systems, in contrast, depend on the security analysis of their publisher. This can be slow and expensive.
