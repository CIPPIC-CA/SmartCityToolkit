# Municipal Procurement 

## Procurement – What is it? 
Procurement is the process of agreeing to terms, acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source. Procurement is different than purchasing a good/service. Purchasing is simply the process of acquiring goods and services. Procurement, in contrast, involves purchasing pursuant to a tendering or bidding process which may involve negotiation among parties. Thus, when a public or private organization begins the procurement process they must: identify what is needed, submit a purchase request, assess and select a vendor, negotiate price and terms, create a purchase order and receive and inspect the goods. 

Municipal procurement involves the expenditure of taxpayer funds, and so tends to be heavily regulated in Canada to ensure accountability, fairness and transparency.
 
## Smart City Procurement: Why is procurement a particularly significant activity for smart cities?
 
A smart city requires tools to collect data and tools to analyze data. For example, to optimize traffic sensors may be placed across traffic lights to collect information on how many cars are on the road. Next, that information will then go to a network to be analyzed then acted on (i.e telling which traffic lights to turn green). It is not feasible for every city to manufacture or implement the infrastructure needed solely on the basis of internal expertise. Municipalities will inevitably need to turn to private sector partners for the expertise to implement and manage many technology-intensive smart city tools.  These will need to be selected though the procurement process. 
 
## Risks – what are the major risks municipalities encounter in smart city procurement?

### Politicians Require Digital Literacy

To decide who is the winner of the tendering process, politicians will need to have high digital literacy. Procurement does not only require finding a vendor that can solve their needs, but it will also require them to find a vendor that solve future unpredicted problems. By committing to a vendor who is unable to solve unforeseen problems, a city may be committed to purchasing and installing out-of-date technology or out-of-scope technology. To overcome this issue, vendors should be tested and demonstrate their products on a smaller scale. This would allow the city to see if the vendor can solve real-life problems in real-time. This will prevent the city from locking in with a vendor who is unable to adapt to problems as they arise. 
 
### Transparency 
As in all procurement situations, smart city procurement requires transparency.  This can be a challenge in the technology space, where private sector partners insist on confidentiality to protect trade secrets. Large smart city projects will often involve public-private partnerships. Such arrangements may put municipalities at a disadvantage

### Vendor Lock-in

Technology acquisitions often implicate long term commitment to a specific vendor.  This creates a danger that a municipality, having committed itself to a particular vendor through a competitive and transparent procurement process, is now at the mercy of the vendor for follow-on services and products. Municipalities need to be aware that taxpayer funds are vulnerable not only through the technology selection process, but also throughout the life cycle of the technology.

Short section on procurement (p32-33)

A holistic guide for municipalities designing smart cities, this document lays out the phases required of a municipality in order to design a fully functioning smart city. The section of most interest to us is phase V where the smart city design is implemented. 

In this phase, the municipality will procure services/goods for the city. While regular public procurement methods are common amongst municipalities, smart cities require knowledge of unfamiliar and innovative solutions. This resource outlines specific steps that a municipality can take in order to procure services/goods for a smart city. The document includes steps recommended both locally and from smart cities outside of Canada. 

In addition to these steps, the guide advocates for an open procurement process so that residents may hold the government accountable and establish trust with their partners. The guide emphasizes the importance of timing in smart city procurement as partners may require an earlier discussion to implement smart city procurement.

Short section on procurement (See p30-33)

The State of Open Smart Communities Report evaluates the current standing of smart cities in Canada. The report analyzes the needs and capacities of these cities, the challenges they face, and the solutions they have looked into so far. The topics covered in the report include data governance, inclusion, procurement, automated decision-making and AI.

The report evaluates the use of open procurement in smart cities. IT procurement is related to data governance and poses privacy and security risk to partners, stakeholders and the government. As a result, the report recommends data ownership, third party resale, re-use parameters, and privacy protection. Having provisions addressing privacy risks will increase trust and allow for transparent procurement processes. 

The section goes on to share specific types of procurement used by Canadian Municipalities
•	Social procurement – Create opportunity to generate social and environmental benefits beyond the value for money structure. 
•	Flexibility in contract arrangements – being locked into a partnership can be costly due to novel changes in smart cities. Avoiding long term contracts or contracts with flexibility can prevent lock-in. 
•	Open Resource Exchange (ORE) – collaborative procurement (open source software development, using open standards, partnering with developers in software) is also recommended in smart cities.

* Open Smart Cities Guide v1.0, OpenNorth, Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1528rqTjzKWwk4s2xKuPf7ZJg-tLlRK8WcMZQbicoGTM/edit 

This Open Smart City Guide is intended to assist stakeholders participating in smart city projects. It includes guidance and examples of open procurement practices. 

Open Source: 
Open Source in the document is defined as a computer software that is available and can be modified with minimal restrictions, usually for free. In the context of procurement, OpenNorth identifies that open source procurement is a way to aid innovation. The guide includes examples from UK and the City of Guelph as jurisdictions that have explored procurement for open sources. 

Open Standards: 
Open North identifies an open smart city standard as something that has well-defined procedures allowing for public participation and liberal terms of access allowing public use of technology. In the context of procurement, OpenNorth uses the City of Montreal’s policy as a guideline (Smart and Digital City Strategy policy). In this policy, the city of Montreal asks for openness in RFPs as a standard for smart city procurement.

Local and Sustainable Procurement: 
Using local, small and medium enterprises whenever possible will allow smart cities to have links with initiatives in the public sector and not just multinational corporations. In order to conduct this type of procurement, a municipality may have to scale down its projects to allow companies to bid on smaller parts of smart city projects and let them grow at a later time.
Included in local procurement measures are local accelerators designed to cultivate innovative ideas from residents. The report cites Montreal’s InnoCité MTL – a smart city accelerator – and Guelph’s Civic accelerator program.

See 2. Financial Transparency and Accountability 

The government of Canada made a commitment to financial transparency which resulted in more transparency in government procurement and spending processes. This means that citizens now have access to open data on the government’s procurement spending and contracts. 
In this planning document, one of the goals included ensuring that Canadians have access to open data on Government of Canada Procurement. Under this milestone, the government has set deadlines for pilot data testing Open Contracting Data Standard, public workshops on open contracting to analyze opportunities and barriers, finally the data is set to be published and updated in august 2020. 

In line with this open plan – the City of Montreal as well as the federal government is using an Open Contracting Data Standard that includes a data visualization tool. The tool has data that can be downloaded by anyone to analyze. This type of disclosure of procurement data in smart cities promotes fair, just and transparent procurement processes.

Future Cities Canada", Evergreen 2017, Link: https://futurecitiescanada.ca/downloads/2018/FCC_ProcurementReport_201809.pdf 

This resource concentrates on sustainable, green infrastructure initiatives. However, the innovative approach to procurement is a good model for smart cities as well. The report recommends using procurement as a proactive tool for sustainability. Encouraging bidders to innovate, submit bids that are low-carbon and working on creating a more flexible procurement process. 

The report also cites “Going Green: Best Practices for Sustainable Procurement”. It outlines how national policy frameworks can change to promote better public procurement. Using the Netherlands as an example, the report illustrates how quality aspects of a particular bid can be monetized shifting away from the regular selection of lowest bid. In the context of the infrastructure project, a software calculation of life cycle impact as well as energy consumption can assist procurement officers to create a price method based on the tender’s design. As a result, bidders will be encouraged to offer innovative designs that are evaluated based on their environment impact rather than compliance to specifications. Finally, life cycle assessments were embedded in the procurement procedure ensuring that the makeup and materials of the good were evaluated based on their life cycle and not just the bidding amount.
 
### Foreign Sources

* Analysing the potential for wide scale roll out of integrated smart cities and communities solutions: Public Procurement models for SCC solutions,   European Commission, 2016 Link: https://eu-smartcities.eu/sites/eu-smartcities.eu/files/2017-09/D8.2_Public%20procurement%20models%20for%20SCC%20solutions.pdf 

This report is a comprehensive analysis of how different public procurement models impact smart city solutions. It describes the types of public procurement models (new and traditional) and then uses case studies to observe trends and make recommendations. 

Defining the traditional forms of public procurement and its challenges, the report introduces Public Procurement of Innovation (PPI). PPI poses the advantage of urban growth, benefits smaller cities, creates room for early evaluation of the product and compare different solutions before selecting one. 

The report identifies four main PPI frameworks. Pre-commercial procurement where procurement of the service/good occurs prior to it being commercially available. Competitive Dialogue allows for conversations with selected participants who have already made an offer. Similarly, competitive procedure with negotiation allows for conversation with the added benefit of including elements of adaptation or innovation. These two are used in cases where technical information cannot be defined prior to procurement. Finally, an innovation partnership allows for development of novel products and services on a commercial scale. This can be specially valuable in cases where the municipality cannot purchase an existing product and needs a novel solution.

The conclusions of the study in the various frameworks found that an open and collaborative market is essential in order to grow smart city solutions. Furthermore, procurement of innovation allows for this level of openness and collaboration.

Based on these solutions, the Commission made essential recommendations some of which I have listed here: 
•	Develop user-friendly guidelines concerning smart cities, and templates and standard text to facilitate procurement. 
•	Assess standards and specifications
•	Review procurement policies to ensure they align with smart city contracting principles. 
  o	Open data in all procurements (make sure it is owned by the city and not supplier)
  o	Incentivize innovation and collaboration
  o	Avoid supplier lock-in
•	Work to cultivate an innovation ecosystem across the city and amon its suppliers
  o	Ensuring that procurement policies are public
  o	Publish any upcoming procurement opportunities giving enterprises time to plan
  o	Involving suppliers in defining of products, creating transparent procedures, and enhancing competitiveness.

The report also includes operational guidelines which may be useful to any municipality planning a smart city procurement process.

* Guidance on Innovation Procurement 
European Commission
Link: https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/29261/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native 

This document is created to assist municipalities in adopting innovation procurement. The document defines and establishes a need for innovative procurement followed by recommendations on creating a framework for adopting innovation procurement. 

The report recommends creating a policy framework that will clearly make an argument for why innovation procurement is needed. An important factor that this section highlights is the role of ambition and policy goals. Innovation procurement holds a “start small, scale up fast” mentality implying that policy makers should begin with a small number of themes to implement innovation in and then grow from there. In addition to this policy framework the document recommends creating an action plan so that the mandate and objective of policy can turn into reality. In addition to ambition, the policy framework includes recommendations on training, collaborative procurement, risk aversion, and building capacity. 

The report foresees attracting innovators as a challenge and makes recommendations on how to tap into innovative personnel. Among many useful recommendations, the section also looks at adopting an open data model—much like in an open smart city—to attract innovators who will participate in innovation procurement. 

Finally, the report creates suggestions on attracting innovation to the public procurement procedure itself. This section is significant to our work as it breaks each part of public procurement and explains how innovation can be integrated into it. Breaking them down by innovation tools and procedures, the final section of the report discusses the operational and structural elements of the procurement process. 

NOTE: the last section is similar to the framework mentioned in the previous source.

The purpose of this guide is to assist cities in implementing public procurement frameworks suitable for smart cities. The guide not only identifies best practices in procurement practices, but also identifies barriers to implementing best practices. Finally, the document is designed in the context of the low-carbon and environmental goods and services (LCEGS) sector but addresses problems that are common to other smart city procedures as well.

Extracting commonalities between different procurement practices in the EU, the guide follows the framework of encourage, enable engage and exemplifying innovative sustainable procurement opportunities. These common characteristics have the potential to assist other cities to design procurement procedures that are successful.

Among the barriers and steps to mitigating these barriers, one of the things mentioned included “procurement procedures inhibiting innovation”. The steps to mitigating this challenge included clauses to let providers introduce innovations during contract life and including specific selection criteria to help bidders evaluate and rank their innovations.

* BC Developers’ Exchange
The BCDevExchange is a platform for delivering digital public services through partnerships with public and private sectors to deliver solutions to public challenges. They have the capacity to act as a matching platform between governments and tech suppliers. By providing a space for developers to innovate, the aim is to encourage and grow the private technology sector through public sector resources to develop products that meet public needs. The BCDevExchange offers the DevOps Platform and Exchange Lab which will host government projects that have been procured.

* Government of BC Request for Qualification (RFQ) template
The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) template is used to create a pre-qualification list of vendors who are eligible to participate in a subsequent procurement process for goods and services. This template is relevant for vendors to demonstrate that their products or services meet the prerequisite performance standards. It can be applied in a smart city solutions context to have vendors demonstrate its product or capacity to meet qualifications before advancing to a solicitation phase.

* Government of British Columbia Procurement Process Guide
This site outlines and describes each phase of the procurement process from planning, pre-award, award, management, and close-out. The guide provides an overview of the different tasks to be completed within each phase and the desired outcome, while building and maintaining vendor relationships. The site provides information on the risks associated with poor vendor relationships, along with potential consequences and mitigation tactics. Although this guide does not provide for the procurement of smart city solutions specifically, the pre-award phase is relevant to addressing the risk of insufficient digital literacy and transparency.

The pre-award phase includes all activities related to a purchasing organization soliciting the opportunity to the marketplace. This guide suggests the use of market research tools to gather information on comprehensive requirements needed and degree of market interest, without conflicts of interest. Notifications are also a tool to ensure transparency or provide information of general interest to a specific group of vendors.

* Saskatchewan

 The Request for Supplier Qualification (RSFQ) guide describes the different elements that must be developed to create a customized document that suppliers understand and respond to. The guide indicates that the template is meant to be customized to match specific competition needs. In particular, Part 1.1 Invitation to Respondents and Appendix A – RFSQ Particulars can be customized to reflect the needs of a smart city technology including the demonstration of solving real problems in real time.
 
* Municipal Innovation Exchange (MIX)

The MIX research report on challenges and opportunities for municipal innovation procurement provides insight to innovation procurement around the world and particularly focuses on Ontario cities as case studies to reflect those barriers and opportunities.

Section on managing risks (See p12)
The report states that risk transfer and management to be at the core of all procurement processes. It identifies a number of risks that governments are not able to transfer to suppliers, including political risk of failure, Indigenous claims, and environmental assessment risks. Otherwise, governments are able to transfer or share risks with a private sector partner. 
Section on flexible procurement approaches and formats (See p 13-17)
This section describes various procurement approaches with flexible formats and highlights the major differences that aim to balance innovation and competition. It describes the following approaches:
•	Traditional RFP – the traditional competitive process in which the government defines a solution and seeks out the most appropriate vendor to provide it
•	Negotiated RFPs – the government and supplier can refine project details and objectives, clarify contractual responsibilities, and address potential risks before signing a binding agreement. Proposals may be ranked and chosen, or shortlisted and invited back to prevent best and final offers.
•	Competitive Dialogue – a multi-stage process that enables procuring organizations to discuss each aspect of procurement with suppliers before issuing an RFP.
•	Innovation Partnership – procuring organizations work with one or more proponents to research, develop and purchase a solution that could be entirely new or modified on existing solution. 
The report also provides a list of recommendations (see p35) to support the development of innovation procurement approaches with due consideration for the unique context of the challenge, proposed solution, and city.

* Guelph Civic Accelerator Case Study 
The Civic Accelerator report describes Guelph’s experiment in reimagining procurement by explaining the Civic Accelerator model, its goals, and how the model works in practice. The report is described to assist and inform other cities in innovating the process within an existing policy framework.

The Civic Accelerator RFP re-configured the procurement process by having city departments articulate unsolved challenges and refined these statements, rather than identifying the products or services intended to purchase. After issuing a RFP, diverse solutions differing from market-ready solutions were presented, and successful were first invited to build out their solution through a co-development process to better understand the problem. The report shared key insights for successful implementation for a Guelph-like model, and included working within existing procurement regulations, as well as being strategic with government and local innovation partners to champion the reimagined model (see p12-17).

* Pittsburgh Smart City Procurement 
This resource advocates for the use of Request for Information (RFI) in the realm of smart cities procurement because it allows companies to respond with information relevant to the city’s challenge and are well suited to conduct market analysis without it becoming outdated. The City of Pittsburgh is one example of an RFI used for the replacement of city streetlights revealed a lack of coherency in the smart city space in terms of best practices or solutions but did reveal that all responses emphasized the value of network. The Pittsburgh case offers one strategy to reimagining the procurement process beginning at the RFI phase. 

* City of Toronto Civic Innovation Office  
 The City of Toronto has released an “Invitation to Partner” (ITP), a more accessible document in lieu of an RFP, to encourage entrepreneurs to get involved in building and imagining a better 311 service. Some of the benefits of this new approach are:
•	Procurement begins with a challenge-based process to understand the problems first, to build appropriate solutions
•	User-centered – successful bidders will not design in a vacuum and must outline how they will collaborate with city staff and residents
•	Less risk – collaboration in a challenge-based procurement identifies difficult barriers early on and may cost lower than those from traditional procurement methods
•	Spur development of civic tech start-ups  

* Canadian Digital Exchange Platform (CDXP)
The CDXP is Canada’s strategy to create a “Government as a Platform” in order to allow government departments to provide any service on any platform, device or trusted partner in a secured manner. The vision of the CDXP is the digitization of all government services at every level of government. This presentation outlines the phases in which a service provider could onboard onto the strategy where the service would work with CDXP to test, deploy and be made public to consumers.

* Montreal Smart and Digital City Bureau City Contracts Transparency
This article describes Montreal’s development of a visualization tool for municipal contracts that allows users to see data that is structured in open contracting format. The open contracting format ensures that public money is spent openly and fairly and supports open data standardization efforts. The article identifies procurement process knowledge to be one challenge in implementing the tool. This was because procurements have different contract lifecycles and varying degrees of complexity associated with administrative approvals. Though the challenges remain, the tool has been subject to evaluation and recommendations so that ongoing improvements are made to improve transparency.

* 18F: Procurement   
 18F is an office within the U.S. General Services Administration that collaborates with agencies to fix technical problems, build digital products, and improve government services through technology. The 18F blog has various posts about ways in which traditional procurement can be changed to increase efficiency. 18F advocates for modular contracting, the practice of breaking up large, custom software procurements into a small constellation of contracts to increase efficiency.

The 18F blog spots frequently describe their work to be agile or have principles of agile underlying their development of procurement processes including software development, product management, user-centered design, and software delivery. 18F has identified contracting tweaks that yielded better procurements that generally involve agile methodologies. In particular, they use an Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for software procurement which requires vendors to demonstrate their ability to use agile practices which would ensure alignment with 18F’s principle of openness and transparency.
