# Introduction to Public Health

As one of the central aspects of government, public health initiatives play a vital role in the everyday lives of citizens. Programs in this domain not only assist people who are sick, but also ensures those who are healthy stay that way. Monitoring issues that pose a threat to public health can greatly improve quality of life. Municipalities that analyze trends and track data in an anticipatory, not reactive, manner to public health issues, are able to take preemptive action before they worsen.
