Municipal governments face the same needs as other organizations:  they must manage the money they receive and spend, hire and fire employees and contractors, and generally manage the enterprise in an organized manner responsive to the needs of their communities and laws under which they operate. Like other organizations, municipal governments meet these demands by provide administrative services such as human resources, legal services, financial services, and other similar services.  And, like other organizations, data and technology tools can facilitate the provision of those services or even permit the introduction of new types of administrative services.

## Services: Data Governance 

An area of particular concern to all data-intensive organizations, including municipal governments, is data governance. An effective data governance system must address competing stakeholder claims and numerous legal, financial and ethical considerations, not all of which will have emerged at the time of its design. A data governance system must therefore delicately balance competing priorities yet also flexibly adjust to new issues.

The value of data has soared in recent years as its value as an input to innovation and in the provision of services has become increasingly apparent.  A range of organizations and entities have become increasingly interested in accessing data stewarded by municipal governments.  Traditional municipal data stewardship models have not emphasized data sharing and instead focused on protecting privacy interests inherent to data, doing so at times when some data subjects would have benefited from more permissive sharing of data and would have positively consented to such sharing. Accordingly, municipal governments have begun exploring data stewardship models that rise to the challenge of maintaining accountability and legal compliance while sharing data with industry and public interest users.

## Applications and Solutions: The Data Trust 

The concept of the “data trust” is drawing a great deal of attention among those who study and address data governance challenges. Data trusts are organizational structures designed to administer data – management of the conditions and terms of access to and use of data – according to principles derived from the common law trust.  A data trust requires trust administrators – the trustee – to administer the data – the contents of the trust – in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. In practice, the concept of the data trust is fluid, and many different organizational structures call themselves “data trusts”.  However, generally a “true” data trust retains two key features: allegiance to the principle that a trustee manages assets in the interests of beneficiaries, and a fiduciary-like responsibility owed by the trustee to beneficiaries so that the terms of the trust may be enforced. In practice, however, many data governance vehicles called “data trusts” retain neither of these features.

Data trusts are just one of a variety of emerging data governance systems, including open data, data commons, data pools, and data co-operatives.

## Technologies 

Cryptography – Data governance involves ensuring that only authorized entities may access data.  Cryptographic solutions provide one means of doing so. Encrypting data both in storage and in transit ensures that only authorized entities can access data.
Blockchain – One of the most interesting data governance applications in recent years has been Barcelona’s DECODE project.  DECODE (which stands for “Decentralised Citizen Owned Data Ecosystem”) uses encryption and blockchain technologies to give city residents greater control over their data. Residents are able to specify the degree of privacy protection they wish to afford data collected through smart municipal appliances and metres. Collected data reflects these preferences, and storing and processing that data on blockchain offers transparent and verifiable processing of resident data.

## Managing Liability Issues

### Privacy
•	Issues.  Data governance usually implicates stewardship of personal information.  
o	Municipal governance routinely involves stewardship of data derived from residents. If that data can be associated or re-associated with identifiable individuals, privacy obligations will emerge. 
o	Not all data governance challenges entail privacy challenges. Public environmental data, for example, is unlikely to entail associations with particular individuals. However, one of the challenges that arises in stewarding data generated by smart city applications is the “identifiability” of data associated with individuals – including ostensibly anonymous individuals.  This will particularly arise where geographic data can be associated with individuals who may prove surprisingly identifiable.
o	Data trusts in particular face privacy issues.  Often trusts-like stewardship models are proposed to overcome challenges with obtaining consent to the collection of data that may include personal information.  For example, data collected in public spaces may well include personal information derived from the movement and activity of individuals through that space.  Trusts have been proposed as solutions to the challenge of obtaining consent from such individuals. 
•	Managing issues. 
o	Data governance vehicles must include privacy compliance as an essential element of responsible stewardship.
o	Data deidentification.  Include de-identification strategies as standard where information is to be shared with third parties and consent is unavailable. If personal information absolutely must be collected, it should be stripped away as soon as possible.
o	Capture data impersonally.  Where data governance objectives don’t require personal information, don’t collect it. 
o	Data-fuzzing. Employ data-fuzzing techniques to preserve privacy. For example, do not include start and end points in route data so that a particular route cannot be traced to an individual. Similarly, fuzzing data of sensitive areas provides an additional layer of security for personal information.
o	De-identify at the source. Many data collection technologies allow for collection of less granular data. 
o	Ensure that partners or contractors follow collection restrictions. When purchasing data from private companies, ensure that they are upholding their own privacy obligations under relevant legislation.
o	Follow good privacy practices.

### Security
•	Issues. Data governance is closely connected to data security.  Indeed, overseeing access is a core data governance activity.
•	Managing issues. 
o	Encryption tools and strategies will protect data in storage and in transit while securing access rights to stewarded data.
o	Many of the same solutions to privacy issues will address security issues:  e.g., de-identify at source if possible, or as soon as possible if otherwise.  Where personal information is collected, it should be held in a secure location.  
o	Follow good security practices
Intellectual Property
•	Issues.  Data governance can include managing access and sharing of data in which an entity enjoys intellectual property rights, such as copyright or confidential information rights.
•	Managing issues. 
o	In dealing with confidential information, non-disclosure agreements will often include crucial details over conditions of access, including:
	The term of use (i.e., an expiry date)
	The identities of individuals who may access the information;
	The permitted uses of the information; and
	Storage conditions (for example, the data may be required to be encrypted and may not be duplicated).
o	License terms of original compilations of data protected by copyright may similarly include conditions of access, such as terms, permitted uses, and other such restrictions.

### Inclusion
•	Issues.  Data governance implies purposive stewardship: data flows are being managed, but to what end? To whose benefit?  
o	Municipalities embracing smart city approaches face the challenge of ensuring that all residents benefit from such approaches.  
o	They also face the challenge of substituting special interests for resident interest.  For example, while consumers undoubtedly benefit from private sector research and innovation, it does not follow that municipal residents would necessarily agree to disclose their data to commercial interests for such purposes.
•	Managing issues. 
o	Trust-like data stewardship structures should have a well-defined trusteeship model.  Such models should identify data beneficiaries and in administer access and exploitation decisions on a good faith assessment of the best interests on those beneficiaries.
o	Multi-stakeholder forum models are not well suited to act as trustees in such structures since, by definition, the loyalties of representatives are divided.  Multi-stakeholder forums may nonetheless provide essential inputs enabling informed trustee decision-making.

   * This report was prepared by the Municipality of Copenhagen and describes the lessons learned from the City Data Exchange (CDE) project which was a data sharing platform that allowed public and private organizations to exchange data as an innovative approach to test the readiness of the market to deliver new data-sharing solutions. This paper presents the key findings and challenges from the CDE and makes recommendations for improving data sharing. The three key insights into creating an effective data infrastructure are of interest. First, establishing solid use cases show how data can be used to address specific challenges or opportunities. Second, creating a regional or national data community to facilitate opportunities. Third, establish common standards for data sharing. These high-level recommendations derived from a real project may assist cities also exploring data sharing platforms.
