# Encouraging Residents to Vote

Voting demographics show that only a subset of residents end up voting. This can be an issue as individuals who are unable to travel to vote are unable to represent their voices. Smart city tools can encourage residents to exercise their democratic right to vote on variety of municipal issues and candidates regardless of whether they can physically access polls.

## Technologies

* Online voting portals can involve residents in everyday municipal decisions from anywhere.
* Engage in campaigns. Campaigns on social media and municipal websites to encourage voting can raise awareness among youth demographics.
* Send voting reminders. Automated text messages can be sent to cell phone users with certain area codes to remind them to vote.
* Rideshare applications. Providing transit for residents who do not have access to a voting centre can encourage residents from voting.
