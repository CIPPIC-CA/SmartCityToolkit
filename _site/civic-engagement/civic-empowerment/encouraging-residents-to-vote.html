<p>Voting demographics show that only a subset of residents end up voting. This can be an issue as individuals who are unable to travel to vote are unable to represent their voices. Smart city tools can encourage residents to exercise their democratic right to vote on variety of municipal issues and candidates regardless of whether they can physically access polls.</p>

<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Online voting portals can involve residents in everyday municipal decisions from anywhere.</li>
  <li>Engage in campaigns. Campaigns on social media and municipal websites to encourage voting can raise awareness among youth demographics.</li>
  <li>Send voting reminders. Automated text messages can be sent to cell phone users with certain area codes to remind them to vote.</li>
  <li>Rideshare applications. Providing transit for residents who do not have access to a voting centre can encourage residents from voting.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="liabilities">Liabilities</h3>

<p><strong>Digital literacy as a prerequisite for voting</strong></p>

<p><strong>Issues</strong>. In order to navigate an online voting system, residents will require some level of digital literacy. Due to lack of digital literacy or mistrust of technology, some residents may be discouraged from voting.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Texting Voting Instructions. Residents should receive information on how to vote online prior to election day.</li>
  <li>Keeping Alternative Forms of Voting Open. Residents who do not wish to participate in online voting should still have to option to vote in person.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>

<p><strong>Issues</strong>. Online voting systems often collect personal information of the voter as well as information on who they voted for.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Issues</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t track.  If it is unnecessary to track voters’ personal information, then the municipality should employ tools that don’t associate individuals with content.</li>
  <li>De-identify as soon as possible.  If personal information absolutely must be collected, it should be stripped away as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>Use non-identifying information as password to voting. Create a secure password on the resident’s voting card limiting the use of identifying information during the actual vote.</li>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://cippic-ca.github.io/SmartCityToolkit/privacy.html">good privacy practices</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Voter Fraud</strong></p>

<p><strong>Issues</strong>. If the online voting system is compromised or hacked, votes may be changed or destroyed compromising the integrity of the election.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Issues</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blockchain voting. Decentralized voting systems where a vote is permanently recorded on blockchain can create a secure online voting system.</li>
  <li>Facial and Voice Recognition Voter Confirmation. Using a camera and microphone to verify the resident’s identity via facial recognition and voice recognition technology can prevent voter fraud.</li>
</ul>
