          <p><strong>Blockchain</strong> - Blockchain technologies combine enctryption, spreadsheet-like applications, and distributed computing to produce a very secure and transparent registry tool.  Blockchains are “distributed ledgers” that permit confidence in the contents of the ledger.</p>

<p><strong>Data Governance</strong> - Data governance is the civic responsibility to manage municipal data responsibly. Municipalitiesshould address key decisions about responsibility for the collection, use, sharing and safe-keeping of the different categories of data generated by smart city technologies in a transparent, principled and coherent fashion rather than in an ad hoc or reactive manner. Data sharing-agreements and data-processing agreements, and public private partnerships generally, should include terms binding private sector partners to the privacy commitments of the municipality.</p>

<p><strong>Data Trusts</strong> - Data trusts are organizational structures designed to administer data – management of the conditions and terms of access to and use of data – according to principles derived from the common law trust.  A data trust requires trust administrators – the trustee – to administer the data – the contents of the trust – in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. In practice, the concept of the data trust is fluid, and many different data governance structures call themselves “data trusts” that in practice do not require data management in the interests of specific beneficiaries, or lack a fiduciary-like enforcement vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Deidentification</strong> - 	De-identification is the process of removing information from a dataset that has the potential to identify an individual.  Standards are being developed in different areas that provide guidance to thorough de-identification.</p>

<p><strong>Innovation Hubs</strong> - Innovation Hubs are a dynamic incubator space where support services can be gathered to help start-up companies access necessary guidance and services to achieve business goals. This includes strategic development and solutions through technology trends, innovation management, industry-specific insights, financing advice and networking opportunities. The hubs can curate and host entrepreneurs from different industries and develop unique programs that build local and international networks, attract talent, and create jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong> - Intellectual property refers to a group of rights in different kinds of intellectual works, like inventions, software, and trade secrets.  Intellectual property rights play a key role in the acquisition, implementation, and operation of smart city tecnologies, and careful  management is necessary to manage risks associated with these rights.</p>

<p><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> - The Internet of Things is the term given to networked devices.  IoT devices are “things” - sensors, meters, tools, vehicles, etc. - that have on-board internet communications capability.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Impact Assessments</strong> - Privacy Impact Assessments are an essential, standardized tool, familiar to privacy regulators and authorities, that help identify privacy risks and issues and ensure regulatory compliance by mitigating the issues raised.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy by design</strong> - Privacy by Design is a principled-based approach to designing technology and services that place privacy and security at the centre of project design and development.  Many privacy issues arise after project design is complete.  These principles help ensure that issues are identified and accordingly addressed early, as an aspect of privacy design rather than as an expensive consequence of project execution.</p>

<p><strong>Procurement</strong> - Procurement is the process of agreeing to terms, acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source. Procurement involves purchasing pursuant to a tendering or bidding process which may involve negotiation among parties.</p>

<p><strong>Smart meters</strong> - Smart meters provide remote meter reading of utilities such as gas, water, and electricity usage.  Smart meters permit data analysis, communicate details of consumption and can also detect and report leaks. These meters can be installed or retrofitted into home, commercial or industrial settings to ensure bill accuracy and promote efficiency. Data from smart meters can be used in mobile apps or web portals that allow customers to view their usage, compare consumption to neighbours, and forecast their next bill.</p>
