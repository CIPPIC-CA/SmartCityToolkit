# About

The Smart City Toolkit is intended to offer a practical description of a range of smart city applications and technologies that can be used to address the needs and services of municipalities across a broad range of municipal services. The Smart City Toolkit is intended to identify not only how data and technology can be applied to existing and new types of municipal services, but also how these approaches raise important issues that should be addressed through planning and informed implementation.

The Smart City Toolkit was created by CIPPIC, the [Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic](https://cippic.ca/). CIPPIC is Canada’s only public interest technology law clinic, and is based at the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Law, Common Law Section. CIPPIC General Counsel David Fewer led CIPPIC’s work on the project, supported by summer interns Jey Kumarasamy, Abby Lenner, Robin McLachlen, Nnubia Ogbuefi, Rachel Poon, Sundeep Virdi and Rohoma Zakir.
