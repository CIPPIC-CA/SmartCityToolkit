# Procurement

## Procurement – What is it?

Procurement is the process of agreeing to terms, acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source. Procurement is different than purchasing a good/service. Purchasing is simply the process of acquiring goods and services. Procurement, in contrast, involves purchasing pursuant to a tendering or bidding process which may involve negotiation among parties. Thus, when a public or private organization begins the procurement process they must: identify what is needed, submit a purchase request, assess and select a vendor, negotiate price and terms, create a purchase order and receive and inspect the goods.

Municipal procurement involves the expenditure of taxpayer funds, and so tends to be heavily regulated in Canada to ensure accountability, fairness and transparency.

## Smart City Procurement: Why is procurement a particularly significant activity for smart cities?

A smart city requires tools to collect data and tools to analyze data. For example, to optimize traffic sensors may be placed across traffic lights to collect information on how many cars are on the road. Next, that information will then go to a network to be analyzed then acted on \(i.e telling which traffic lights to turn green\). It is not feasible for every city to manufacture or implement the infrastructure needed solely on the basis of internal expertise. Municipalities will inevitably need to turn to private sector partners for the expertise to implement and manage many technology-intensive smart city tools. These will need to be selected though the procurement process.

## Risks – what are the major risks municipalities encounter in smart city procurement?

### Politicians Require Digital Literacy

To decide who is the winner of the tendering process, politicians will need to have high digital literacy. Procurement does not only require finding a vendor that can solve their needs, but it will also require them to find a vendor that solve future unpredicted problems. By committing to a vendor who is unable to solve unforeseen problems, a city may be committed to purchasing and installing out-of-date technology or out-of-scope technology. To overcome this issue, vendors should be tested and demonstrate their products on a smaller scale. This would allow the city to see if the vendor can solve real-life problems in real-time. This will prevent the city from locking in with a vendor who is unable to adapt to problems as they arise.

### Transparency

As in all procurement situations, smart city procurement requires transparency. This can be a challenge in the technology space, where private sector partners insist on confidentiality to protect trade secrets. Large smart city projects will often involve public-private partnerships. Such arrangements may put municipalities at a disadvantage

### Vendor Lock-in

Technology acquisitions often implicate long term commitment to a specific vendor. This creates a danger that a municipality, having committed itself to a particular vendor through a competitive and transparent procurement process, is now at the mercy of the vendor for follow-on services and products. Municipalities need to be aware that taxpayer funds are vulnerable not only through the technology selection process, but also throughout the life cycle of the technology.
