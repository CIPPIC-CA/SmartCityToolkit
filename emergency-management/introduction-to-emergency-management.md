# Introduction to Emergency Management

Municipal emergency services address the safety and well-being of both property and the person. Emergency services include the fire services that protect us from harm, the police services that monitor and address crime and disturbances, and the medical emergency services that respond when we are suddenly sick or injured. Smart city applications may improve the performance of existing infrastructure in these areas and also offer innovative approaches to service delivery.
