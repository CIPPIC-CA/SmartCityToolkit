# Municipal Procurement 

## Procurement – What is it? 
Procurement is the process of agreeing to terms, acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source. Procurement is different than purchasing a good/service. Purchasing is simply the process of acquiring goods and services. Procurement, in contrast, involves purchasing pursuant to a tendering or bidding process which may involve negotiation among parties. Thus, when a public or private organization begins the procurement process they must: identify what is needed, submit a purchase request, assess and select a vendor, negotiate price and terms, create a purchase order and receive and inspect the goods. 

Municipal procurement involves the expenditure of taxpayer funds, and so tends to be heavily regulated in Canada to ensure accountability, fairness and transparency.
 
## Smart City Procurement: Why is procurement a particularly significant activity for smart cities?
 
A smart city requires tools to collect data and tools to analyze data. For example, to optimize traffic sensors may be placed across traffic lights to collect information on how many cars are on the road. Next, that information will then go to a network to be analyzed then acted on (i.e telling which traffic lights to turn green). It is not feasible for every city to manufacture or implement the infrastructure needed solely on the basis of internal expertise. Municipalities will inevitably need to turn to private sector partners for the expertise to implement and manage many technology-intensive smart city tools.  These will need to be selected though the procurement process. 
 
## Risks – what are the major risks municipalities encounter in smart city procurement?

### Politicians Require Digital Literacy

To decide who is the winner of the tendering process, politicians will need to have high digital literacy. Procurement does not only require finding a vendor that can solve their needs, but it will also require them to find a vendor that solve future unpredicted problems. By committing to a vendor who is unable to solve unforeseen problems, a city may be committed to purchasing and installing out-of-date technology or out-of-scope technology. To overcome this issue, vendors should be tested and demonstrate their products on a smaller scale. This would allow the city to see if the vendor can solve real-life problems in real-time. This will prevent the city from locking in with a vendor who is unable to adapt to problems as they arise. 
 
### Transparency 
As in all procurement situations, smart city procurement requires transparency.  This can be a challenge in the technology space, where private sector partners insist on confidentiality to protect trade secrets. Large smart city projects will often involve public-private partnerships. Such arrangements may put municipalities at a disadvantage

### Vendor Lock-in

Technology acquisitions often implicate long term commitment to a specific vendor.  This creates a danger that a municipality, having committed itself to a particular vendor through a competitive and transparent procurement process, is now at the mercy of the vendor for follow-on services and products. Municipalities need to be aware that taxpayer funds are vulnerable not only through the technology selection process, but also throughout the life cycle of the technology.

   * Short section on procurement (See p30-33) The report evaluates the use of open procurement in smart cities. IT procurement is related to data governance and poses privacy and security risk to partners, stakeholders and the government. As a result, the report recommends data ownership, third party resale, re-use parameters, and privacy protection. Having provisions addressing privacy risks will increase trust and allow for transparent procurement processes.

   * This resource concentrates on sustainable, green infrastructure initiatives. However, the innovative approach to procurement is a good model for smart cities as well. The report recommends using procurement as a proactive tool for sustainability. Encouraging bidders to innovate, submit bids that are low-carbon and working on creating a more flexible procurement process. The report also cites “Going Green: Best Practices for Sustainable Procurement”. It outlines how national policy frameworks can change to promote better public procurement.

The guide not only identifies best practices in procurement practices, but also identifies barriers to implementing best practices. Finally, the document is designed in the context of the low-carbon and environmental goods and services (LCEGS) sector but addresses problems that are common to other smart city procedures as well.

The open contracting format ensures that public money is spent openly and fairly and supports open data standardization efforts. The article identifies procurement process knowledge to be one challenge in implementing the tool. This was because procurements have different contract lifecycles and varying degrees of complexity associated with administrative approvals. Though the challenges remain, the tool has been subject to evaluation and recommendations so that ongoing improvements are made to improve transparency.
