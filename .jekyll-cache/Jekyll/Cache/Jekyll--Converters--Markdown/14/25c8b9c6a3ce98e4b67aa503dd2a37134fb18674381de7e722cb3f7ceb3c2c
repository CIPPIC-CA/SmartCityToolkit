<p>Smart cities are for everyone. Municipalities embracing smart city tools and solutions may focus on big projects (like road and highway infrastructure) and enabling citizenswho already own technological tools (such as smart phones and home computers). The problem with this approach is that it does not consider who might be left out of benefiting from these improved services. Not everyone owns a car or a smart phone. Similarly, smart technologies often presume that all users are similarly abled, when we know that this is not so.  Persons with disabilities face multiple layers of marginalization and require specific services to participate in civic decision-making.</p>

<p>We should always ask of every smart city proposal and initiative, who is left out? Just as a municipality must serve all who live within its boundaries, a smart city must similarly benefit all.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many smart city solutions and technologies that focus on accessibility and inclusion.  Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free municipal WIFI.</strong> Municipalities cannot use smart city tools to reach the disability community if residents lack access to the internet. Adding WIFI routers to public areas that are accessible to the disability community will improve online access to services.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital accessibility maps.</strong> Municipal maps driven by resident-contributed data can rate the accessibility of different areas in the municipality. Residents will have access to information on accessibility such as whether a particular location has a ramp, braille text, and automatic doors.</li>
  <li><strong>Service delivery telephone systems.</strong> Residents may dial in for information on municipal services such as transportation, request accommodations for public events, and be updated on changes to municipal disability policies.</li>

  <li><strong>Customer Service Applications.</strong> Designing applications that combine multidisciplinary professional services (legal, medical, or social) can resolve the multi-layered issues people with disability face without having to redirect the resident to a variety of services. The application can screen an issue and identify what type of professional the resident needs. These applications can also assist the wider resident community as anyone can utilize this service.</li>
