<p>The smart city can promote civic engagement by reaching out to members of the public to encourage participation in civic decision-making.  Examples of common municipal public outreach initiatives include public hearings, surveys, and advertising. However, if there is insufficient public outreach, residents may not hear about the types of services that a municipality offers. This may lead to consequences such as a municipality only serving the interests of select members of a community. Smart city tools can resolve these problems by making municipal services and information more accessible to residents unreachable via regular channels.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll look at two public outreach applications:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Educating neighbourhoods on safe street practices, and</li>
  <li>Outreach to the disability community.</li>
</ol>
