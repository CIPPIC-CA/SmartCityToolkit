# Introduction to Municipal Administration

Municipal governments face the same needs as other organizations: they must manage the money they receive and spend, hire and fire employees and contractors, and generally manage the enterprise in an organized manner responsive to the needs of their communities and laws under which they operate. Like other organizations, municipal governments meet these demands by provide administrative services such as human resources, legal services, financial services, and other similar services. And, like other organizations, data and technology tools can facilitate the provision of those services or even permit the introduction of new types of administrative services.
