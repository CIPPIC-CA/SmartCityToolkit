# Introduction to Infrastructure

Municipalities have primary responsibility over a majority of local infrastructure that are critical to community health and well-being, prosperity, mobility, and safety. Examples of municipal infrastructure include:

• Municipal buildings, community centers, arenas, fire stations, libraries, police stations, public housing, and outdoor washrooms  
• Water treatment plants, towers, intake and sewage pipes and pumping stations • Waste management disposal facilities and recycling stations • Roads, sidewalks, traffic lights and streetlights • Public transit infrastructure and stations • Parks, outdoor swimming pools, rinks, and other outdoor structures

The maintenance and replacement of capital assets and infrastructure is integral to the provision and delivery of reliable services. Smart city solutions can unlock insights to optimize and automate maintenance activities reducing service costs while improving accuracy, reporting, and tracking of infrastructure performance. Many of these tools can be seamlessly integrated into infrastructure design providing reliable information to measure performance and outcomes.
