# Introduction to Parks and Recreation

Public parks and recreational facilities engage community and civic activity by providing accessible spaces for exercise, play and interaction with the natural world.

But parks and recreational facilities are sometimes underutilized, struggling to maintain essential community services in the face of diminishing resources.

Municipalities can use data and technology to increase the efficiency with which these areas are maintained and the ease with which these services are accessed. Smart parks and recreational facilities can involve members of the community who may have become disconnected from these public spaces.
